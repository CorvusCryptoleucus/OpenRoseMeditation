    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>Open Rose Meditation was born out of a desire to create a space for community and inner peace. From January 2013 through December 2014, I had the privilege of hosting bi-weekly meditation sessions at Multnomah County Libraries. These gatherings were free and open to the public, providing a sanctuary for anyone seeking mindfulness and relaxation in their lives.</p>

    <h2>A New Beginning</h2>
    <p>In the spring of 2024, my employer offered me the opportunity to lead a weekly online group meditation at work. This experience reignited my passion for shared meditation practice and inspired me to bring Open Rose Meditation back, this time as an online resource. My hope is to reach even more people, offering them the tools and space to find peace in their daily lives.</p>

    <h2>Roots and Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, a region known for its natural beauty and rich cultural tapestry. Over the years, I have drawn influence from the great wisdom traditions of the world, incorporating these teachings into my practice and sharing them with others. Open Rose Meditation is a reflection of this journey—a space where diverse spiritual insights come together to foster growth and understanding.</p>
